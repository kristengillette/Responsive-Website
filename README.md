# Responsive-Website

Project created for <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse Tech Degree</a> program. 

In this project I built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The design responds to small, medium, and large viewport sizes and devices; and demonstrates an understanding of responsive design.

I wrote basic layout styles to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
